## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

*   **Java Development Kit (JDK) 17:** This project requires JDK 17. You can check your Java version by running:

    ```bash
    java -version
    ```

    If you don't have JDK 17 installed, download and install it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?version=17) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html). Make sure to set your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable correctly.
*   **Maven:** This project uses Maven for dependency management and building. The Maven Wrapper (`mvnw`) is included, so you don't need to install Maven separately.
